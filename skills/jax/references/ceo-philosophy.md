# CEO Philosophy (Operational Summary)

> This document translates leadership insights into working principles. It's not inspiration — it's a **checklist**.

## 1) This Is a Data Product (Not a Chat Product)

- The chat/UI is just the interface for capturing signals
- The real value: **data → analysis → opportunities** (for customers and for us)
- Any engineering work should answer: **"What data will we get from this? What will we learn?"**
- If the answer is "nothing," it's probably not a priority

## 2) Delivery and the Cost of Time

- Time is expensive: every week that passes costs opportunities
- Preference for "taxi/bus" solutions over "walking":
  - **Do what gets you to a real test fastest**, even if you improve it later

**Practical rule:**
- If something takes too long, find an **MVP** that delivers signal in days, not weeks

## 3) Measure Before Debating

```
"What do we want to observe?"
    → Define events/metrics
    → Instrument
    → Observe
    → Decide
```

Without metrics, you only have opinions.

## 4) Prioritize by Business Impact ("Win the Game")

- Don't optimize sub-objectives (e.g., "not conceding goals") if the overall goal is different (e.g., grow, retain, activate)
- A goalkeeper's job isn't to stop goals — it's to **win the match**. In the 90th minute, losing 2-1, you go up for the corner.
- When there's conflict, decide by: **business impact + learning**

## 5) Reduce, Simplify, Put On Hold

- Saying "no" or "on hold" is a product decision
- If a task doesn't move the needle or generate learning, **park it**
- Don't build for the sake of building

## 6) Engineers Must Think Like Product Owners

- You can't be a great engineer in the AI era without understanding the business side
- Don't just "stop goals" — play the whole game
- Ask: What's happening with users? Why? What are they trying to do?
- Go see the product in the real world. Talk to users.

## 7) How to Apply This (60 Seconds)

Before building anything:

1. **What user pain does this address?**
2. **How do we measure success?**
3. **What data do we need?**
4. **What's the minimum MVP to learn something?**
5. **What are we leaving out (on hold)?**

## The Restaurant Analogy

**Bad:** "People are hungry, let's make food" → You make food → "I'm gluten intolerant" → Back to kitchen → "I'm lactose intolerant" → Back to kitchen...

**Good:** "What do you want?" → "Chicken with potatoes" → "What kind of chicken? How do you like it cooked? What kind of potatoes?" → You make exactly what they want → Customer loves it.

You can be an amazing cook, but if you serve gluten to someone with celiac disease, your cooking skill is worth zero.

**Build what users actually want. Ask first. Understand deeply. Then build.**

## The Goalkeeper Analogy

What's a goalkeeper's objective?

Most people say: "Don't let them score."

Wrong. **The objective is to win the match.**

When it's the 90th minute, you're losing 2-1 in the Champions League final, and there's a corner... what does the goalkeeper do? Goes up to the box. Why? Because at that point, stopping a goal doesn't matter — you've already lost. The only way to win is to help score.

**Don't optimize for sub-goals. Optimize for the real objective.**
