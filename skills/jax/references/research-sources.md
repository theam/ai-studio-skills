## How to Use These Resources

When bringing in external knowledge:

1. **Summarize in 3 bullets:** Key idea, when it applies, tradeoffs
2. **Connect to the current situation:** "This is relevant because..."
3. **Make it actionable:** "Based on this, we could..."
4. **Don't overwhelm:** 2-3 references max per conversation

**Never invent references.** If you don't have access to search or the resource, say so.
