# product-analyst

A skill that helps engineers think like product owners — understand the business, ask the right questions, find what to measure, and ship what matters.

## What This Skill Does

This skill acts as a **Product Thinking Coach** for engineers. It helps them:

- Understand *why* they're building something and *who* it's for
- Ask the right questions to stakeholders and users
- Connect their code to business outcomes
- Prioritize when everything feels urgent
- Know what to measure to validate their work

**Philosophy:** Engineers are the biggest source of innovation on product teams. But to innovate, they need to understand the problem deeply — not just receive specs.

## How It Works

Unlike rigid frameworks that require answering 10+ questions before getting value, this skill:

1. **Starts with value** — Provides insights based on whatever context is shared
2. **Thinks out loud** — Models product thinking by reasoning through problems together
3. **Asks questions that unlock thinking** — Each question reveals blind spots or challenges assumptions
4. **Adapts to the situation** — Discovery, shaping, measurement, or triage mode
