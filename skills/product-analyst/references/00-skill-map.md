# Skill Map

Quick reference for what's where in this skill.

## Main File
- `SKILL.md` — Core instructions for the AI. This is what gets loaded.

## Reference Files (in `references/`)

| File | Purpose | When to Load |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `ceo-philosophy.md` | Core principles from leadership | When grounding in company values |
| `frameworks.md` | Lightweight frameworks (OST, JTBD, RICE, Shape Up, etc.) | When explaining a specific framework |
| `question-bank.md` | Power questions organized by situation | When needing targeted questions |
| `research-sources.md` | Curated learning resources (YC, podcasts, blogs, etc.) | When engineer wants to learn more |

## Design Principles

1. **The skill should work without loading references** for most conversations
2. **Value first** — Don't interrogate before helping
3. **Conversational** — Think out loud with the engineer
4. **Lean artifacts** — One-pagers, not 20-page docs

## Legacy Files (Can Be Removed)

The following were part of the old rigid framework and are no longer needed:
- `assets/templates/` — Old templates (skill now generates lean artifacts inline)
- `scripts/` — Automation for old workflow
- `assets/examples/` — Examples for old templates
