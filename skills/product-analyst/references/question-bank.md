| What's painful about how they do it today? | The gap your solution needs to fill |
| What happens if we don't solve this? | True priority vs. nice-to-have |
| How do they work around this today? | Existing behavior you need to understand |

## Red Flags to Probe

When you hear these, dig deeper:

| Statement | Follow-Up Question |
|-----------|-------------------|
| "The PM/stakeholder said to build X" | "What problem does X solve? What happens if we don't?" |
| "Users want feature Y" | "What job are they trying to do? Are there other ways?" |
| "We need to build everything in the spec" | "What's the core? What could we cut and still learn?" |
| "We'll add analytics later" | "How will we know if this works without them?" |
| "We've always done it this way" | "Is there evidence it's working? What would we change?" |
| "We need this for the demo" | "Is this the right thing to build, or just the fastest?" |
